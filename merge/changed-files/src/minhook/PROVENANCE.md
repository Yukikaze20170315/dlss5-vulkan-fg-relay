# Vendored MinHook

The hook engine, buffer allocator and trampoline builder match
[m417z/minhook at 4f18d1809a81e6c700bcc4a21aeb43ade72bbf8b](https://github.com/m417z/minhook/tree/4f18d1809a81e6c700bcc4a21aeb43ade72bbf8b),
with these local differences (ignoring UTF-8 BOMs and line endings):

- `hook.c`: `TEXT("ntdll.dll")` works in both ANSI and Unicode builds; added
  `MH_RetireHook` / `MH_RetireHookEx` remove records for unmapped targets without
  touching target memory or freeing executable buffers. Those buffers remain
  allocated until process exit in the bridge. Retirement runs outside loader notifications.
- `hook.c`: on `WAIT_ABANDONED`, release the mutex ownership granted by Windows
  before returning `MH_ERROR_MUTEX_FAILURE`. All guarded APIs use the same helper.
- `buffer.c` / `hook.c` / `MinHook.h`: the SR carrier alone opts into
  `MH_CreateHookPrologueExtended`, retaining ±1 GiB allocation first and trying
  ±0x7FFF0000 only when that fails. The wider path requires the live five-byte
  `mov [rsp+8], rbx` prologue at creation and again under thread freeze at enable;
  it rejects existing jumps that might hide a different underlying prologue.
  Ordinary hooks keep the original range and the five-byte E9 chain ABI.
- `trampoline.c` / `hook.c`: reject out-of-range RIP-relative relocation and
  relay jump displacements instead of truncating them to 32 bits.
- `MinHook.h`: declarations/documentation for retirement; omitted an upstream
  comment about a possible future thread-freeze method.
- `src/hde/*`: the complete HDE directory instead matches
  [TsudaKageyu/minhook v1.3.4, c3fcafdc10146beb5919319d0683e44e3c30d537](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook/tree/c3fcafdc10146beb5919319d0683e44e3c30d537/src/hde).
  Its decoder is used as a consistent set; no newer m417z decoder changes are mixed in.

The bridge uses the default documented thread enumeration method. It does not
enable the optional `NtGetNextThread` optimization. This integration makes no
claim of improved FPS or universal compatibility with third-party detours.

`tests/build-module-lifetime-test.cmd` tests two independently loaded copies of
this engine on the same target and removes them in both orders. The hook tests
also cover concurrent forwarding, retirement and address reuse.

Original licensing is retained in `LICENSE.txt` and `AUTHORS.txt`.

Security review on 2026-09-13 corrected the reference above from the upstream
master commit to the multihook commit actually matching the vendored engine.
This corrects the documentation only; the shipped source and binary are unchanged.
